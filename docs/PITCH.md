# InclusiveAI - 3-Minute Pitch

## Problem Statement

**Over 1 billion people worldwide live with disabilities**, facing daily challenges accessing digital interfaces. Traditional one-size-fits-all designs exclude many users, creating barriers to technology access.

## Solution: InclusiveAI

**InclusiveAI is a Smart Assistive Platform** that uses camera-based interaction analysis (with explicit consent) to suggest optimal assistive interfaces for users with disabilities.

### Key Features

1. **Camera-Based Assist Mode Detection**
   - Observes interaction cues (with consent)
   - Suggests optimal interface (Voice, Sign, Text, Gesture, Motor)
   - On-device processing for privacy
   - Explainable AI with confidence scores

2. **Multi-Modal Assistive Interfaces**
   - **Voice-First:** For low-vision/blind users
   - **Sign Language:** For deaf users
   - **Text-Based:** For hearing-impaired users
   - **Gesture:** For motor-impaired users
   - **Motor-Adapted:** Large buttons, switch mode

3. **Privacy-First Architecture**
   - Explicit consent flows
   - On-device processing
   - No medical diagnosis claims
   - Immediate data deletion

## Demo Flow

1. **Onboarding:** User clicks "Scan" → Consent modal appears
2. **Guided Scan:** 20-second interaction test (wave hands, speak, look at camera)
3. **Recommendation:** System suggests "Sign-first UI" (0.92 confidence) with explainability
4. **Accept:** User accepts → Sign-mode interface appears
5. **Override:** User can manually override or delete camera data anytime

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React + MediaPipe (on-device ML)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
- **AI/ML:** MediaPipe, scikit-learn, rule-based classifier
- **Privacy:** Local-first processing, encrypted storage

## Market Impact

- **Target Users:** 1+ billion people with disabilities
- **Use Cases:** Education, healthcare, employment, daily life
- **Scalability:** Cloud-optional, works offline
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Privacy-First:** On-device processing, explicit consent
2. **Explainable AI:** Users understand recommendations
3. **Multi-Modal:** Supports 5+ assist modes
4. **Non-Medical:** Clear disclaimers, no diagnosis claims
5. **User Control:** Manual override, data deletion

## Business Model

- **B2C:** Freemium model (basic free, premium features)
- **B2B:** Enterprise licenses for organizations
- **B2G:** Government contracts for accessibility compliance

## Traction & Validation

- **Prototype:** Fully functional MVP
- **Privacy Compliance:** GDPR/CCPA ready
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- **User Testing:** Ready for disabled user testing

## Ask

- **Funding:** $500K seed round for user testing, ML model training, and scaling
- **Partnerships:** Disability organizations, accessibility advocates
- **Advisors:** Accessibility experts, privacy engineers

## Vision

**"Technology should be accessible to everyone, regardless of ability."**

InclusiveAI empowers people with disabilities to access digital interfaces on their own terms, with privacy, transparency, and user control at the core.
